                    With a weapon in their hand and their resolve strengthened, warriors represent anything from a
                    savage barbarian to a noble knight, these people have spent their lives training in the art of
                    combat. With their experience and heavy weaponry, warriors bring hope to allies and dismay to
                    enemies who are to face their steel. Being a barrier to their allies but also a spear against the
                    enemy’s defences, warriors bring their combat prowess to any party that has them.
